## Why RYNAN Oxygen Generator?


- **Enhanced Shrimp Health and Growth:**  
  Proper dissolved oxygen (DO) levels are crucial for shrimp health and growth. Optimal DO supports overall development, resulting in accelerated growth rates and maximized productivity.
- **Enhanced Feed Conversion:**  
  Optimized DO enhances shrimp feeding efficiency, promoting increased activity, appetite, and feed intake. This leads to improved feed conversion rates and enhanced production efficiency.
- **Increased Survival Rates:**  
  Sufficient oxygen levels prevent hypoxia-induced mortality by ensuring oxygen-rich water, thereby promoting overall shrimp well-being.
- **Time-Saving and Efficiency:**  
  Seamlessly integrated with the TOMGOXY App, it eliminates manual DO checks and physical operation of the oxygen pumping system—saving valuable time and resources.

# Sustainable Shrimp Farming - RYNAN Aquaculture


## The Role of Mangroves in Shrimp Farming  
Mangroves provide key environmental benefits in shrimp farming. They naturally filter water, enhance ecosystem balance, and act as efficient carbon sinks.


## Benefits of Mangrove Conservation in Shrimp Farming  
- **Water Quality and Filtration**  
  - Mangroves filter pollutants, reducing external water treatment needs.  
- **Carbon Sequestration**  
  - Reduces carbon emissions, supporting low-emission farming practices.


## TOMGOXY®: A Sustainable Farming Model  
The **TOMGOXY®** solution integrates mangrove conservation, dedicating 30% of farm land to mangroves, transforming shrimp farms into eco-friendly operations with carbon-neutral benefits.
